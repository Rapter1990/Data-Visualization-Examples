# Star Wars Movie Scripts

Star Wars is a popular film franchise that takes place in a galaxy far, far away. This is a collection of script dialogue between characters for the first three movies (episodes 4-6). Since it's a holiday (and just because Star Wars is an awesome movie), this data should serve as a fun way to implement text mining and linguistics.
